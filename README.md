# StudyControl
## What StudyControl is
StudyControl is a study tool that is designed to improve academic performance. 
StudyControl helps to fight procrastination and to improve academic discipline, making educational process more managable and enjoyable.
## Notes
- *This readme is being developed and not the final version*
- *Current version of the app lacks most of the features final app will have, but does allow to demonstrate some of the most important concepts*
- *The current repo will no longer be updated. New and final version will be build on MEAN*
- *Taking ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (LHTL) course is highly recommended prior to using the app.*

## How to use StudyControl

## How StudyControl works
- StudyControl makes use of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 
and
- StudyControl suggests or enforces some of the main concepts and techniques outlined in the course ["LHTL"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). 
  - Interleaving - changing subjects every 30 minutes or so. This helps to build knowledge that lasts longer.  
  - Focusing on the process and not on the result - concentrating on filling up the cells instead of concetrating on final result, like midterm project, helps with procrastination. 
  - Deliberate practice - fullfilling weekly goal, even when you feel like you're done with homework, helps to fight illusion of mastery. 
  - Spaced repetition - filling up the cells over extended period of time, instead of cramming all at once.

What makes StudyControl such a powerfull tool is combination of the Pomodoro timer and a powerful presentation tool.
Pomodoro part helps to decrease ammount of mental power needed to overcome initial resistence assosiated with starting work on certain subjects. For instance, imagine working on term paper. The mere thought about ammount of work associated with delivering big project evokes unpleasent feeling and  our brain changes focus on more pleasent things like watching TV. This is commong source of procrastination. By using pomodoro we need to overcome only initial resistance associated with clicking a button on the timer and then we can focus on process.

Study control collects information about each session and presents it to the user in the way that helps to frame our thinking in terms of 30 minutes intervals. This works on several levels. One level is that this approach helps to perceive time as finite recourse that should be allocated wisely. Another is that, again, student thinks about filling up the table and not about impending gigantic homework.

Our brain strives for control and structure as was also noticed by one of the LHTL's students:
> I have cancelled several commitments since this course has started so that I could stay home and take notes on video lectures and do my Pomodoros (on my to do list I write down the number of Pomodoros I am going to apply on each topic instead of a length of minutes or hours, I just like writing '2 pomodoros' ;) And I feel fantastic!
As we can see, this student does exactly what StudyControl does, but in very oldfashioned way by making paper-based checklist.

Main table consists of two columns. One column is for academic subjects and another column is for usefull non-academic things  like fiction books of podcasts. 


## History
In the beginning of 2013, I was avid user of the [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I noticed that codecademy enforced a habbit of coding every day by sending reminders and giving badges for maintaining "streak". This approach gave me sensation of control and structure. 
Later that year I enrolled in business program at [BCIT](http://www.bcit.ca/) and I really wanted to perform well. I figured I could try to give my studies a bit more structure. I created simple spreadseet that looked like this:

![first_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/first_sheet.png)

The spreadsheet evolved over time, and now it looks like this: 

![second_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/secons_sheet.png)

The idea was simple. I would track ammount of time I spend on every subject. Every cell represented 30 minutes interval. All I needed to to is to remember the time I started woring on a subject and the time I ended. 
I couldn't make a spreadsheet that would be flexible enough to store correct data and to render straightforward UI. So it doesn't do either. It looks too complex and learing curve is too steep. But it is very powerfull nontheless. 
Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyAN5yKMNYc_HySc2362zKyYhqxHhFMci4HFjhcIbG4/pubhtml) itself. This document allows to track the evolution of the system over the three years that I've been using it.

Interestengly, when I started working on this spreadsheet I was not aware of any of the learing techniques disscussed here. Moreovere, I was sure there was no need for nonsese like that. Learning for me was something the one is born with and not something one can aquire. Only later I was introduced to concepts outlined in LHTL and I saw why my system worked and how I can improve it.
