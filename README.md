StudyControl helps to fight procrastination and to improve academic discipline, making educational process more managable and enjoyable.
## Notes
- *This readme is being developed and not the final version*
- *Current version of the app lacks most of the features final app will have, but does allow to show most important concepts*
- *The current repo will no longer be updated. New and final version will be build on MEAN*
- *Taking ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course is highly recommended prior to using the app. *

## How to use StudyControl

## How StudyControl works
StudyControl makes use of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and takes it a step further by enforcing some of the main concepts outlined in the course ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), such as: interleaving; focusing on process and not on result an deliberate practice and spaced repetition.

What makes StudyControl such a powerfull tool is combination of Pomodoro timer and powerful presentation tool. 
Study control collects information about each session in traditional way. Some sessions only take 15 minutes while other take full 30 minutes. Instead of showing ammount of time spent on a subject in a row format (transaction-like), StudyControl groups the time in easy to digest chunks. This way of presenting information frames our mind to perceive time as finite recourse 


I'd like to present this extract from one of the reviews of the Learning How to Learn course. :
> I have cancelled several commitments since this course has started so that I could stay home and take notes on video lectures and do my Pomodoros (on my to do list I write down the number of Pomodoros I am going to apply on each topic instead of a length of minutes or hours, I just like writing '2 pomodoros' ;) And I feel fantastic!
This student also feels need to structure the studies and does it oldfashioned way by making paper-based checklist.
  
  
  
  



## History
In the beginning of 2013, I was avid user of the [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I noticed that codecademy enforced a habbit of coding every day by sending reminders and giving badges for maintaining "streak". This approach gave me sensation of control and structure. 
Later that year I enrolled in business program at [BCIT](http://www.bcit.ca/) and I really wanted to perform well. I figured I could try to give my studies a bit more structure. I created simple spreadseet that looked like this:

![first_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/first_sheet.png)

The spreadsheet evolved over time, and now it looks like this: 

![second_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/secons_sheet.png)

The idea was simple. I would track ammount of time I spend on every subject. Every cell represents 30 minutes spent on a subject. I would write down on the piece of paper the time I started woring on a subject and the time I ended. 
I couldn't make a spreadsheet that would be flexible enough to store correct data and to render straightforward UI. So it doesn't do either. It looks too complex and learing curve is too steep. But it is very powerfull nontheless. 
Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyAN5yKMNYc_HySc2362zKyYhqxHhFMci4HFjhcIbG4/pubhtml) itself. This document allows to track the evolution of the system over the three years that I've been using it.
