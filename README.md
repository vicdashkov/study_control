## What this is
StudyControl incorporates main principles of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and takes it a step further by enforcing some of the main concepts outlined in this course ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). I highly recommend to take this course for everyone. The system helps to fight procrastination and to improve discipline. The results are increase of academic grades and knowledge that lasts for long time. 
## History
In the beginning of 2013 I was hooked on the [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and at that time they really wanted you to code every day, even for a little bit. I loved it a lot. It gave me sensation of control and structure. Later that year I enrolled in business program at [BCIT](http://www.bcit.ca/) and I really wanted to perform well. I figured I could try to give my studies a bit more structure and the quest begin.

First version of the system was developed in December 2013. This was a simple spreadsheet that looked like this: ![first_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/first_sheet.png)
The idea was that every cell represents 30 minutes of studying. Study for 30 minutes. Put the name of the subject in the respective cell. Repeat.
The spreadsheet evolved over time. And now it look something like this: 
[second_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/secons_sheet.png)

Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyAN5yKMNYc_HySc2362zKyYhqxHhFMci4HFjhcIbG4/edit?usp=sharing) itself, The document is not historically accurate, but does allow to track the evolution of the system.

The spreadsheet is not flexible enough to store data and render straightforward UI. So it doesn't do either. It worked for me, but I'm sure not too many people will find it particularly useful.
This leads me to creation of the app.
