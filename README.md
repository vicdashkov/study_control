## History
In the beginning of 2013, I was avid user of the [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I noticed that codecademy enforced a habbit of coding every day by sending reminders and giving badges for maintaining "streak". This approach gave me sensation of control and structure. 
Later that year I enrolled in business program at [BCIT](http://www.bcit.ca/) and I really wanted to perform well. I figured I could try to give my studies a bit more structure. I created simple spreadseet that looked like this:
![first_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/first_sheet.png)
The spreadsheet evolved over time. And now it look something like this: 
![second_sheet](https://github.com/vicdashkov/study_control/blob/master/images/secons_sheet.png)

I couldn't make spreadsheet that would be flexible enough to store correct data and to render straightforward UI. So it doesn't do either. It looks too complex and learing curve would be too steed for most people, but it is nontheless very powerfull. I'd like to show how to use it to give a better idea of all the feature Study

Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyAN5yKMNYc_HySc2362zKyYhqxHhFMci4HFjhcIbG4/edit?usp=sharing) itself. This document allows to track the evolution of the system over the three years that I've been using it.
## How StudyControl works
StudyControl incorporates main principles of the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and takes it a step further by enforcing some of the main concepts outlined in the course ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).
StudyControl enforces good practices that are not always apparent and seem to be counterintuitive(see LHTL course for more details) such as: interleaving; chunking; deliberate practice and planning.
